## 🔧 Task Analyzed: Kitchen Faucet Installation

### Scope
Installation of kitchen faucets and associated components provided in pre-packaged kits by the manufacturer (Pfister).

### Crew & Productivity
- **Crew Size:** 4 workers (2 per unit)
- **Production Rate:** 6 units/day (3 units per 2-person crew)
- **Average Installation Time:** ~22 minutes per unit
- **Tasks Include:**
  - Material retrieval from ground-level storage
  - Faucet, sink strainer, garbage disposal, and drainpipe installation
  - Leak testing and inspection

## ⚙️ Productivity Analysis

- **Time Utilization:** Some idle time due to material transport, coordination with other tasks, and tool setup.
- **Productivity Factors:**
  - Confined working space increases time
  - Manual handling of kits across floors
  - Transition time between units
- **Improvements Suggested:**
  - Material staging per floor
  - Optimized crew sequencing
  - Dedicated support personnel

## 🧍 Ergonomic Risk Analysis

- **Main Stressors:**
  - Kneeling under the sink for extended periods
  - Repeated position changes (kneeling ↔ standing)
  - Overhead drilling and high-force tasks
- **Ergonomic Rating:**
  - Moderate to high OWAS score
  - High ergonomic load during drilling and strainer installation
- **Recommendations:**
  - Use of knee pads, padded mats
  - Adjustable tools to reduce awkward posture
  - Consider task rotation

## 🛑 Safety Risk Assessment

### Risks Identified:
- **Manual Handling:** Risk of back strain (low severity)
- **Ergonomic Hazards:** High repetition, awkward posture (high severity)
- **Slips/Trips/Falls:** Low risk due to clean site
- **Struck-by Hazards:** Moderate risk (no safety glasses, gloves)
- **Confined Space Hazards:** Present under sink

### Safety Recommendations:
- Mandatory PPE: Gloves, safety glasses, hard hats
- Clean and organize workspaces
- Introduce rest breaks and task rotation
- Ergonomic training for workers

---

## ⚖️ Trade-offs: Productivity vs Safety

- Improving productivity (e.g., faster installation, fewer transitions) can increase ergonomic stress.
- Safety enhancements (rest breaks, PPE compliance) might reduce daily output.
- Goal: Balance productivity with safety by leveraging ergonomic tools, task scheduling, and lean principles.
